User: You are a **frontend software engineer** working on an existing internal product.

You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
(no framework, no build tools, no external UI libraries).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality

The baseline application already supports a basic task dashboard, including:

* A task table with search, filter, sorting, and pagination
* Read-only task detail view
* Local mock data
* Minimal styling and no advanced UI feedback

The baseline is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task

Improve and polish the existing UI by adding **visual quality, clearer feedback, richer interactions, and in-context guidance**, while keeping all baseline behavior intact.

This task focuses on **real-world frontend craftsmanship**, not just feature completeness.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. UI Visual Quality & Frontend Polish (Mandatory)

You must significantly improve the overall look and feel of the application.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* A clear and structured layout (header, controls, content area, sidebar)
* Improved spacing, typography, and alignment
* A consistent and intentional color system
* Clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary elements
* Polished table presentation with hover states and readable density
* Subtle animations or transitions where appropriate
* Reasonable responsiveness on smaller screens

The UI should feel **intentional, modern, and production-quality**, not just restyled.

---

### 2. Loading, Error, and State Feedback

* Display a loading indicator while tasks are being fetched
* Handle simulated loading failures with clear error messages
* Avoid layout jumps during loading or error states
* Clearly indicate active search, filters, and sorting
* Provide a single action to reset all view state (filters, sorting, pagination)

---

### 3. Inline Task Status Updates

* Allow task status updates directly within the table
* Enforce the transition order: `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show row-level loading
  * Prevent duplicate actions
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately
  * Briefly highlight the updated task
* On failure:

  * Show an inline error and revert state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

---

### 4. Usability Enhancements (All Required)

Implement all of the following:

* Highlight matching keywords in task titles during search
* Provide a clear empty-state view when no tasks match current filters, including a reset action
* Make table rows clearly interactive through hover and cursor feedback
* Visually mark recently updated tasks for a short duration without breaking sorting or filtering

---

### 5. Usage Guide Sidebar

Add a **persistent usage guide sidebar** to the page.

The sidebar must:

* Be visible alongside the main content (not a modal)
* Briefly explain how to:

  * Search tasks
  * Filter and sort results
  * Navigate pagination
  * Update task status inline
* Use concise, instructional language
* Be visually distinct but unobtrusive
* Adapt reasonably on smaller screens (collapsible or stacked layout is acceptable)

The usage guide must be part of the UI itself, not only documented in README.

---

## Constraints

* Do not remove or break existing functionality
* Do not rewrite the application using a framework
* No backend or external services
* All state remains client-side
* Incremental improvement only; avoid unnecessary abstraction

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code
* Clearly improved UI styling
* A **README.md** describing:

  * How to run the demo
  * Key UI and interaction improvements
  * How inline status updates work
  * Design decisions, including the usage guide sidebar

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass

* Baseline behavior remains intact
* UI is clearly more polished, modern, and usable
* Feedback and state changes are clear and consistent
* Usage guide sidebar is accurate and helpful
* Code changes are readable and incremental
* README allows full reproduction

### Fail

* Baseline functionality is broken
* UI improvements are superficial
* State handling is confusing or fragile
* Usage guide is missing or misleading
* Code is unnecessarily rewritten
* README is incomplete


GitHub Copilot: Optimizing tool selection...Let me inspect the baseline files to plan the UI improvements. I'll open the main files now.

Searched for files matching `**/*.{html,js,css}`, 2 matches

Read [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_17/v-coralhuang_25_12_17_case2/index.html)

Read [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_17/v-coralhuang_25_12_17_case2/app.js)

Perfect! I found the baseline files; next I'll update index.html (layout + sidebar + styles) and app.js (loading, inline updates, search highlight, empty state), and add `README.md`. Proceeding to apply the edits now.

Using "Multi-Replace String in Files"


```

```
Proceeding to update app.js with loading/error handling, search highlight, inline updates, and UI state management. I'll replace the script with the revised implementation.

Using "Replace String in File"


```

```


Created [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_17/v-coralhuang_25_12_17_case2/README.md)

Checked [](file:///c%3A/Bug_Bash/25_12_17/v-coralhuang_25_12_17_case2/app.js), no problems found

Perfect! The UI polish, loading/error handling, inline status updates, search highlighting, empty state, and usage guide sidebar are implemented. My next step is to run a quick smoke-check in your browser—open index.html and exercise search, filters, simulate error, and inline updates; tell me any tweaks you'd like.

Made changes.
