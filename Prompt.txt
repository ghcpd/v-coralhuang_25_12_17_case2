You are a **frontend software engineer** working on an existing internal product.

You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
(no framework, no build tools, no external UI libraries).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality (Already Implemented)

The existing application provides the following features:

* A single dashboard page displaying a list of tasks
* Each task includes:

  * Task ID
  * Title
  * Assignee
  * Status (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`)
  * Created At timestamp
* Search tasks by title keyword
* Filter tasks by status
* Sort tasks by clicking table headers (single-column sort)
* Client-side pagination with configurable page size
* Click a table row to open a **read-only task detail modal**
* All data is loaded from a local mock data source
* No loading indicators or error handling
* No inline editing or state mutation
* Minimal visual styling

The baseline UI is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task: Improve and Polish the Existing UI

You must **extend and enhance the provided baseline code** with **visual polish, usability improvements, and richer interactions**, while keeping all existing behavior working.

This task focuses on **real-world UI quality**, not just functionality.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. Visual Design & Layout Polish (Mandatory)

You must significantly improve the visual quality of the page:

* Introduce a clear visual hierarchy (header, controls, content, footer areas)
* Improve spacing, alignment, and typography
* Use a consistent color palette for:

  * Primary actions
  * Secondary actions
  * Status indicators
* Add subtle shadows, borders, and hover transitions
* Make the table visually easier to scan (row separation, hover feedback)
* Ensure the layout works well on smaller screens (basic responsiveness)

> Purely cosmetic changes are **not sufficient**; the UI should feel noticeably more professional.

---

### 2. Loading and Error Feedback

* Add a visible loading indicator while task data is being fetched
* Gracefully handle simulated data loading failures
* Display clear, user-friendly error messages
* Loading and error states must not break or shift the layout unexpectedly

---

### 3. Filter, State, and Context Visibility

* Search and status filters must be visually represented as **active state indicators**
* Clearly show the currently applied filters above the table
* Add a one-click action to clear **all filters, sorting, and pagination state**
* Improve visual distinction of task statuses using color badges or labels

---

### 4. Inline Task Status Update (Interaction Complexity)

* Allow users to update task status directly from the table
* Status transitions must follow this order only:

  * `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show a loading indicator on the affected row
  * Disable other actions for that row
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately without a page refresh
  * Visually indicate the update (e.g., brief highlight)
* On failure:

  * Show an inline error message
  * Revert the UI state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

---

### 5. Advanced Usability Enhancements (All Required)

You must implement **all** of the following:

1. **Search Result Highlighting**

* Highlight matched keywords in the **Title** column
* Highlighting must update live as the user types
* Highlighting must not break sorting or pagination

2. **Empty-State Design**

* When no tasks match the current filters:

  * Replace the table body with a designed empty-state view
  * Include:

    * A short explanation
    * A clear call-to-action to reset filters

3. **Row Interaction Affordances**

* Make it visually obvious that rows are interactive:

  * Cursor changes
  * Hover background
  * Optional icon or indicator
* Affordances must coexist cleanly with inline status updates

4. **Recently Updated Task Emphasis**

* When a task status is updated:

  * Visually mark it as recently updated
  * Keep it highlighted for a short duration
* This must not break sorting or filtering logic

---

## Constraints

* Do not remove or break any existing baseline features
* Do not rewrite the application using a framework
* Do not introduce a backend or external services
* All state must remain client-side
* Keep the code readable and maintainable
* Incremental improvement is expected, not a full redesign
* Avoid unnecessary abstractions

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code
* Significantly improved UI styles
* A **README.md** that includes:

  * How to run the demo locally
  * A summary of visual and functional improvements
  * Explanation of inline status update logic
  * Notes on key design and UX decisions

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass

* Baseline behavior remains fully functional
* UI is visibly more polished and professional
* Interaction feedback is clear and consistent
* State changes are predictable and well handled
* Code changes are incremental and understandable
* README allows full reproduction

### Fail

* Baseline functionality is broken
* Changes are mostly cosmetic without interaction depth
* State handling is fragile or confusing
* UI feels inconsistent or unfinished
* Code is rewritten unnecessarily
* README is missing or unclear
