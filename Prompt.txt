You are a frontend software engineer working on an existing internal product.
You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript** (no framework, no build tools).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality (Already Implemented)

The existing application provides the following features:

* A single dashboard page displaying a list of tasks
* Each task includes:

  * Task ID
  * Title
  * Assignee
  * Status (`TODO`, `IN_PROGRESS`, `DONE`)
  * Created At timestamp
* Search tasks by title keyword
* Filter tasks by status
* Sort tasks by clicking table headers (single-column sort)
* Client-side pagination with configurable page size
* Click a table row to open a **read-only task detail modal**
* All data is loaded from a local mock data source
* No loading indicators or error handling
* No inline editing or state mutation

The baseline UI is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task: Improve the Existing UI

You must **extend the provided baseline code** with usability and interaction improvements, while keeping all existing behavior working.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. Loading and Error Feedback

* Add a visible loading indicator while task data is being fetched
* Gracefully handle data loading failures
* Display clear, user-friendly error messages
* Loading and error states must not break the existing layout

---

### 2. Filter and State Visibility Improvements

* Search and status filters must be clearly visible as active conditions
* Show the currently applied filters in the UI
* Add a one-click action to clear all filters and sorting
* Improve visual distinction of task statuses (e.g. color tags or badges)

---

### 3. Inline Task Status Update

* Allow users to update task status directly from the table
* Status transitions must follow this order only:

  * `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show a loading indicator on the affected row
  * Prevent duplicate actions
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately without a page refresh
* On failure:

  * Show an error message and revert the UI state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

---

### 4. Usability Enhancements (All Required)

You must implement **all** of the following usability enhancements:

1. **Highlight matched keywords in search results**

* When a search query is non-empty, highlight the matching substring(s) in the **Title** column.
* Highlighting must update live as the user types.

2. **Improve empty-state UI when no tasks match filters**

* If the filtered result set is empty, replace the table body with a clear empty-state message.
* The empty-state must include a one-click action to reset filters/sorting.

3. **Add hover affordances to indicate clickable rows**

* Make it visually obvious that rows are clickable (e.g., cursor change + subtle hover background + optional right-arrow indicator).
* The affordance must not interfere with sorting or inline status controls.

---

## Constraints

* Do not remove or break any existing baseline features
* Do not rewrite the application using a framework
* Do not introduce a backend or external services
* All state must remain client-side
* Keep the code readable and maintainable
* Incremental improvement is expected, not a full redesign

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code
* Improved UI styles with clear visual hierarchy
* A **README.md** that includes:

  * How to run the demo locally
  * A summary of improvements made
  * Explanation of how inline status updates work
  * Notes on key design decisions

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass

* Baseline behavior remains fully functional
* Improvements clearly enhance usability and clarity
* UI feedback is visible and consistent
* Code changes are incremental and understandable
* README allows full reproduction

### Fail

* Baseline functionality is broken
* Improvements are cosmetic only
* State handling is inconsistent or confusing
* Code is rewritten unnecessarily
* README is missing or unclear
