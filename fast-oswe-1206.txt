User: You are a **frontend software engineer** working on an existing internal product.

You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
(no framework, no build tools, no external UI libraries).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality

The baseline application already supports a basic task dashboard, including:

* A task table with search, filter, sorting, and pagination
* Read-only task detail view
* Local mock data
* Minimal styling and no advanced UI feedback

The baseline is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task

Improve and polish the existing UI by adding **visual quality, clearer feedback, richer interactions, and in-context guidance**, while keeping all baseline behavior intact.

This task focuses on **real-world frontend craftsmanship**, not just feature completeness.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. UI Visual Quality & Frontend Polish (Mandatory)

You must significantly improve the overall look and feel of the application.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* A clear and structured layout (header, controls, content area, sidebar)
* Improved spacing, typography, and alignment
* A consistent and intentional color system
* Clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary elements
* Polished table presentation with hover states and readable density
* Subtle animations or transitions where appropriate
* Reasonable responsiveness on smaller screens

The UI should feel **intentional, modern, and production-quality**, not just restyled.

---

### 2. Loading, Error, and State Feedback

* Display a loading indicator while tasks are being fetched
* Handle simulated loading failures with clear error messages
* Avoid layout jumps during loading or error states
* Clearly indicate active search, filters, and sorting
* Provide a single action to reset all view state (filters, sorting, pagination)

---

### 3. Inline Task Status Updates

* Allow task status updates directly within the table
* Enforce the transition order: `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show row-level loading
  * Prevent duplicate actions
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately
  * Briefly highlight the updated task
* On failure:

  * Show an inline error and revert state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

---

### 4. Usability Enhancements (All Required)

Implement all of the following:

* Highlight matching keywords in task titles during search
* Provide a clear empty-state view when no tasks match current filters, including a reset action
* Make table rows clearly interactive through hover and cursor feedback
* Visually mark recently updated tasks for a short duration without breaking sorting or filtering

---

### 5. Usage Guide Sidebar

Add a **persistent usage guide sidebar** to the page.

The sidebar must:

* Be visible alongside the main content (not a modal)
* Briefly explain how to:

  * Search tasks
  * Filter and sort results
  * Navigate pagination
  * Update task status inline
* Use concise, instructional language
* Be visually distinct but unobtrusive
* Adapt reasonably on smaller screens (collapsible or stacked layout is acceptable)

The usage guide must be part of the UI itself, not only documented in README.

---

## Constraints

* Do not remove or break existing functionality
* Do not rewrite the application using a framework
* No backend or external services
* All state remains client-side
* Incremental improvement only; avoid unnecessary abstraction

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code
* Clearly improved UI styling
* A **README.md** describing:

  * How to run the demo
  * Key UI and interaction improvements
  * How inline status updates work
  * Design decisions, including the usage guide sidebar

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass

* Baseline behavior remains intact
* UI is clearly more polished, modern, and usable
* Feedback and state changes are clear and consistent
* Usage guide sidebar is accurate and helpful
* Code changes are readable and incremental
* README allows full reproduction

### Fail

* Baseline functionality is broken
* UI improvements are superficial
* State handling is confusing or fragile
* Usage guide is missing or misleading
* Code is unnecessarily rewritten
* README is incomplete

Completed: *Add usage guide sidebar and README* (5/5)

✅ **Done — UI polished, loading/error & inline status updates added + usage guide sidebar**  
I kept the baseline behavior intact and implemented the requested improvements in an incremental, no-framework way.

---

## 🔎 What I changed (high level)
**Files updated**
- index.html — layout + styles + usage guide + loading / error / empty placeholders
- app.js — improved rendering (sort indicators, search highlighting), **loading/error flow**, **inline status updates**, **row highlight** on success, inline error messages, `reset` behavior, and a small fake-mock API with failure probability.
- README.md — docs to run the demo + short description of the UX behaviors.

---

## 💡 Key UX improvements I implemented
- **Clear layout**: header + content + persistent **usage guide sidebar** (adaptable for smaller screens).
- **Visual polish**:
  - Consistent spacing, typography & color palette
  - Hover & focus states for rows and controls
  - Sort indicator arrows on column headers
  - Search keyword highlighting (`<span class="highlight">`)
- **Loading / Error**:
  - Loading spinner shown while tasks are fetched
  - Simulated 20% chance of load failure → clear error message with a **Retry**
  - Loading and error UI use stable space to avoid layout jumps
- **Inline status updates**:
  - `Start` (TODO → IN_PROGRESS) and `Complete` (IN_PROGRESS → DONE) buttons appear inline
  - Row-level spinner while updating; duplicate actions prevented
  - Success: row is briefly highlighted
  - Failure: inline error message is shown, state reverts
- **Usability**:
  - Empty-state view when no items are found (with **Reset** button)
  - Active state styling for search / filter controls
  - Row cursor + hover emphasize clickability
- **Reset**: single **Reset** button clears search, filter, sort and pagination, and removes transient updates.

---

## ▶️ How to run / test
1. Open index.html in a web browser (no build tools / servers).
2. Tasks are loaded locally (small delay), sometimes fails (simulated) → click **Retry** in the error banner.

---

## 🗂 Notes / design choices
- **No external libs** — purely vanilla JS + CSS
- Mock API returns local generated tasks with a small simulated delay and occasional failures to demonstrate error UI
- Inline updates are one of `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE` — enforced in UI; the update logic is mocked (no backend)
- **Responsiveness**: layout collapses to stacked on small screens (media query)
- **Highlighting / animations**: row highlights on recent update; search matches highlighted in titles

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Add unit tests/specs
- Wire the demo to a real backend API
- Further refine mobile layout, add keyboard accessibility, or persist state in local storage

Would you like me to extend any particular behavior or add tests?

User: where is your data on the web

GitHub Copilot: The demo uses **local, client-side mock data only**.  
No network requests are made and no data is stored or fetched from the web. All task data is generated in the browser by the `seededTasks()` / `listTasks()` functions in the code.

User: open the html, I did not see the mock data

GitHub Copilot: Perfect — I found the mock data is generated in JavaScript (not hardcoded into the HTML).  
Next I’ll show you where to find it and how to inspect it in the browser.

---

## 🔎 Where the mock data lives (the data isn't in index.html)

**The tasks are generated client-side by the JavaScript in app.js**:

- **`seededTasks()`** (in app.js) generates an array of 57 task objects with `id`, `title`, `assignee`, `status`, and `createdAt`.
- **`listTasks()`** simulates an API call (with a delay and failure chance); the result of `listTasks()` is used to populate the table.

### Key code (excerpt from app.js)
```js
function seededTasks() {
  const assignees = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol", "David", "Eve"];
  const base = Date.now() - 1000 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 30;
  const tasks = [];
  for (let i = 1; i <= 57; i++) {
    const status = i % 3 === 0 ? "DONE" : i % 3 === 1 ? "TODO" : "IN_PROGRESS";
    tasks.push({
      id: `T-${pad(i, 4)}`,
      title: `Task ${i} - ${i % 2 === 0 ? "Quarterly" : "Weekly"} report`,
      assignee: assignees[i % assignees.length],
      status,
      createdAt: new Date(base + i * 6 * 3600 * 1000).toISOString()
    });
  }
  return tasks;
}

// "Mock API" (delay and occasional failure)
async function listTasks() {
  await new Promise((r) => setTimeout(r, 80));
  if (Math.random() < 0.2) throw new Error("Failed to fetch tasks. Please try again.");
  return seededTasks();
}
```

## 🧭 How to inspect the rendered mock data

1. Open index.html in a browser (no server is required).
2. Open the developer tools (F12 or right-click → Inspect).
3. In the **Console** or **Elements** tab:
   - You can run `document.querySelectorAll('#tbody tr')` to see the rows the script has inserted.
   - Inspect the `tbody` inside `<table aria-label="Task table">` to see the rows rendered.

---

If you'd like, I can:
- Show you exactly where the `render()` function injects the rows into the DOM (it's in app.js).
- Add a button to show a JSON dump of the current tasks for easier inspection.

Would you like a quick snippet you can run in the browser console to dump the tasks?
