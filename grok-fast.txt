User: You are a **frontend software engineer** working on an existing internal product.

You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
(no framework, no build tools, no external UI libraries).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality

The baseline application already supports a basic task dashboard, including:

* A task table with search, filter, sorting, and pagination
* Read-only task detail view
* Local mock data
* Minimal styling and no advanced UI feedback

The baseline is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task

Improve and polish the existing UI by adding **visual quality, clearer feedback, richer interactions, and in-context guidance**, while keeping all baseline behavior intact.

This task focuses on **real-world frontend craftsmanship**, not just feature completeness.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. UI Visual Quality & Frontend Polish (Mandatory)

You must significantly improve the overall look and feel of the application.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* A clear and structured layout (header, controls, content area, sidebar)
* Improved spacing, typography, and alignment
* A consistent and intentional color system
* Clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary elements
* Polished table presentation with hover states and readable density
* Subtle animations or transitions where appropriate
* Reasonable responsiveness on smaller screens

The UI should feel **intentional, modern, and production-quality**, not just restyled.

---

### 2. Loading, Error, and State Feedback

* Display a loading indicator while tasks are being fetched
* Handle simulated loading failures with clear error messages
* Avoid layout jumps during loading or error states
* Clearly indicate active search, filters, and sorting
* Provide a single action to reset all view state (filters, sorting, pagination)

---

### 3. Inline Task Status Updates

* Allow task status updates directly within the table
* Enforce the transition order: `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show row-level loading
  * Prevent duplicate actions
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately
  * Briefly highlight the updated task
* On failure:

  * Show an inline error and revert state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

---

### 4. Usability Enhancements (All Required)

Implement all of the following:

* Highlight matching keywords in task titles during search
* Provide a clear empty-state view when no tasks match current filters, including a reset action
* Make table rows clearly interactive through hover and cursor feedback
* Visually mark recently updated tasks for a short duration without breaking sorting or filtering

---

### 5. Usage Guide Sidebar

Add a **persistent usage guide sidebar** to the page.

The sidebar must:

* Be visible alongside the main content (not a modal)
* Briefly explain how to:

  * Search tasks
  * Filter and sort results
  * Navigate pagination
  * Update task status inline
* Use concise, instructional language
* Be visually distinct but unobtrusive
* Adapt reasonably on smaller screens (collapsible or stacked layout is acceptable)

The usage guide must be part of the UI itself, not only documented in README.

---

## Constraints

* Do not remove or break existing functionality
* Do not rewrite the application using a framework
* No backend or external services
* All state remains client-side
* Incremental improvement only; avoid unnecessary abstraction

---

## Deliverables

You must submit:

* Updated HTML, CSS, and JavaScript source code
* Clearly improved UI styling
* A **README.md** describing:

  * How to run the demo
  * Key UI and interaction improvements
  * How inline status updates work
  * Design decisions, including the usage guide sidebar

---

## Evaluation Criteria

### Pass

* Baseline behavior remains intact
* UI is clearly more polished, modern, and usable
* Feedback and state changes are clear and consistent
* Usage guide sidebar is accurate and helpful
* Code changes are readable and incremental
* README allows full reproduction

### Fail

* Baseline functionality is broken
* UI improvements are superficial
* State handling is confusing or fragile
* Usage guide is missing or misleading
* Code is unnecessarily rewritten
* README is incomplete

## Summary

I have successfully enhanced the baseline Task Management Dashboard with all required improvements while maintaining backward compatibility. Here's what was implemented:

### ✅ **UI Visual Quality & Frontend Polish**
- **Modern Layout**: Structured design with header, persistent sidebar, and main content area
- **Professional Styling**: CSS variables for consistent colors, improved typography (Inter font), proper spacing and alignment
- **Visual Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between primary/secondary elements with appropriate shadows and borders
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-optimized layout that stacks sidebar below content on smaller screens
- **Subtle Animations**: Loading spinners, hover transitions, and highlight animations

### ✅ **Loading, Error, and State Feedback**
- **Loading States**: Spinner and loading messages during task fetching (800ms delay)
- **Error Handling**: Clear error messages with retry functionality (10% simulated failure rate)
- **State Indicators**: Active search/filter/sort states clearly communicated
- **Reset Functionality**: Single "Reset All" button clears all filters, sorting, and pagination

### ✅ **Inline Task Status Updates**
- **Interactive Dropdowns**: Status selects directly in table rows
- **Workflow Enforcement**: Strict progression: TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE
- **Update Feedback**: Row-level loading spinners, prevents duplicate actions
- **Success Handling**: Immediate UI updates with 2-second green highlight
- **Error Recovery**: Failed updates show alerts and revert status (15% failure rate)

### ✅ **Usability Enhancements**
- **Search Highlighting**: Matching keywords in task titles highlighted with `<mark>` tags
- **Empty States**: Helpful messages when no tasks match filters, with reset action
- **Interactive Rows**: Clear hover feedback and pointer cursors
- **Recently Updated**: Tasks visually marked for 2 seconds after successful updates

### ✅ **Usage Guide Sidebar**
- **Persistent Guide**: Always visible sidebar with concise instructions
- **Complete Coverage**: Explains search, filtering, sorting, status updates, pagination, and details view
- **Responsive**: Stacks below main content on mobile devices
- **Unobtrusive**: Subtle styling that doesn't interfere with main content

### ✅ **Deliverables**
- **Updated Source Code**: Enhanced index.html and app.js with all new features
- **Comprehensive README**: Detailed documentation covering setup, improvements, and design decisions

### **Technical Highlights**
- **Vanilla Implementation**: No frameworks, build tools, or external libraries
- **Error Simulation**: Realistic network delays and failure rates for testing
- **Performance**: Efficient rendering with minimal DOM manipulation
- **Accessibility**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML, and keyboard navigation
- **Browser Compatibility**: Modern ES6+ features with graceful fallbacks

The application now provides a production-quality user experience while maintaining all baseline functionality. You can run it by opening index.html in any modern browser or serving it with a local HTTP server.
