You are a **frontend software engineer** working on an existing internal product.

You are given a **working baseline web UI demo** for a **Task Management Dashboard**.
The baseline source code has already been provided to you.

The application is implemented using **plain HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript**
(no framework, no build tools, no external UI libraries).

The baseline application **runs correctly** and must **not be rewritten from scratch**.

---

## Baseline Functionality

The baseline application already supports a basic task dashboard, including:

* A task table with search, filter, sorting, and pagination
* Read-only task detail view
* Local mock data
* Minimal styling and no advanced UI feedback

The baseline is intentionally simple and functional.

---

## Your Task

Improve and polish the existing UI by adding **visual quality, clearer feedback, richer interactions, and in-context guidance**, while keeping all baseline behavior intact.

This task focuses on **real-world frontend craftsmanship**, not just feature completeness.

---

## Required Improvements

### 1. UI Visual Quality & Frontend Polish (Mandatory)

You must significantly improve the overall look and feel of the application.

This includes, but is not limited to:

* A clear and structured layout (header, controls, content area, sidebar)
* Improved spacing, typography, and alignment
* A consistent and intentional color system
* Clear visual hierarchy between primary and secondary elements
* Polished table presentation with hover states and readable density
* Subtle animations or transitions where appropriate
* Reasonable responsiveness on smaller screens

The UI should feel **intentional, modern, and production-quality**, not just restyled.

---

### 2. Loading, Error, and State Feedback

* Display a loading indicator while tasks are being fetched
* Handle simulated loading failures with clear error messages
* Avoid layout jumps during loading or error states
* Clearly indicate active search, filters, and sorting
* Provide a single action to reset all view state (filters, sorting, pagination)

---

### 3. Inline Task Status Updates

* Allow task status updates directly within the table
* Enforce the transition order: `TODO → IN_PROGRESS → DONE`
* While updating:

  * Show row-level loading
  * Prevent duplicate actions
* On success:

  * Update the UI immediately
  * Briefly highlight the updated task
* On failure:

  * Show an inline error and revert state

(Mock update logic is acceptable; no backend required.)

### 4. Usability Enhancements (All Required)
